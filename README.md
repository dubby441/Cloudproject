## Step-by-Step Documentation: Server Provisioning and Deployment  

### 1. **Creating the Web Page**  
- Designed a simple HTML page with minimal CSS for styling using Visual Studio Code.  
- Focused on clean and professional design while keeping the implementation lightweight.  

### 2. **Provisioning the Server**  
- Utilized **AWS EC2** to create a virtual server instance:  
  - Assigned an instance name, generated a key pair, and created a security group.  
  - Configured the security group to allow **HTTP traffic** (port 80).  
- After launching the instance, connected to the server using **SSH** through the **Termius** terminal.  

### 3. **Installing and Configuring Nginx**  
- Installed Nginx on the server with the following commands:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install nginx -y
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  sudo systemctl enable nginx
  ```  
- Verified the installation by visiting the server's public IP address in a browser to confirm the default Nginx page was displayed.  

### 4. **Transferring Project Files**  
- Used **WinSCP**, a file transfer software, to upload the project folder (`cloudproject`) to the server manually. However, the command below also works:
- Copied the project files to Nginx's root directory with:  
  ```bash
  sudo cp -r ~/cloudproject/* /var/www/html/
  ```  
- Verified the file transfer by listing the contents of the root directory:  
  ```bash
  ls -l /var/www/html
  ```  

### 5. **Enabling HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt**  
- Installed the required packages for managing SSL certificates:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
  ```  
- Obtained and installed a free SSL certificate for the domain `dubem.web.jumpingcrab.com`:  
  ```bash
  sudo certbot --nginx -d dubem.web.jumpingcrab.com
  ```  
  This command automatically configured the Nginx server to enable HTTPS.  

### 6. **Verifying the SSL Certificate**  
- Verified the SSL certificate by visiting [https://dubem.web.jumpingcrab.com](https://dubem.web.jumpingcrab.com).  
- Ensured the secure connection was active by checking for the padlock icon in the browser‚Äôs address bar.  

### 7. **Running the Web Page**  
- Refreshed the browser using the public IP address or domain to display the deployed landing page.
