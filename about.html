    <h1>Details About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Chidubem Harrison Okpala with student ID: ALT/SOE/024/1168. I am from Anambra state in Nigeria and studied electrical engineering at Anambra State University. After school, I worked as a project engineer, managing site projects involving pipeline installations for over four years before traveling for my master's.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am in Portugal, where I completed my master's degree in data-driven marketing with a specialization in data science. I am a newbie in software engineering but am steadily improving my skills as a cloud engineer, gaining knowledge in Linux, Bash scripting, AWS, Git, networking, and more.</p>
